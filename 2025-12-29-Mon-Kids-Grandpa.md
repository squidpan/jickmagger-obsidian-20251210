# Hello

Vancouver Grandpa passed away yesterday morning, Monday December 29 2025 from VGH, 5 days after Grandma. He went comfortably after stopping the IV the day before, a decision we all agreed on after consulting with the doctors. Everyday, I put my iphone next to him on the pillow and played tunes from Youtube like this one "~~ Riding on the wind and turning with the tide ~~ ". I said, Dad your eyes are wide open now. what's up? you like the sounds of these songs? 

Mom and Dad will be cremated and ashes will be kept at Hampton place until we are able to move them to their final locations that honor their wishes. We are taking the necessary steps.
