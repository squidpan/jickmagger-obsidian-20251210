# Hello

Hello kids,

I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. It was good to see Sophie over Thanksgiving week and would like to also see Alex one of these days. Can we work on it?

Grandpa has been in ER for a week after a massive stroke that damaged parts of his left and right brain. There will be no further treatments. Doctor says he does not feel pain and is comfortable. We are leaving tomorrow on the 25th PM and will go see him first thing at VGH on Friday 26th. 

Grandma's memory is not all there sometimes and her condition is declining.
