# Hello

Vancouver Grandpa passed away yesterday morning from VHG. It was on Monday December 29 2025 and 5 days after Grandma. They say, it's the best final gift from them. 

He went comfortably after stopping the IV the day before, a decision we all agreed to after consulting with the doctors. Everyday, I laid my iphone speaker next to his right ear and played Youtube tunes like this one "~~ Riding on the wind and turning with the tide ~~ ". I said, Dad your eyes are wide open now. what's up? you like the sounds of these songs? 

Mom and Dad will be cremated and ashes will be kept at Hampton place until we are able to move them to their final locations that honor their wishes. We are taking steps to get cremation done before we leave.

Love,

dad
