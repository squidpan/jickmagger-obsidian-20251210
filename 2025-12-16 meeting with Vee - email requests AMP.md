# Summary
- first overview from Vee on current email request process (e.g. BST) and discussed terminology
1. Source/Custodian codes (e..g BST for JPMorgan chase)
2. Client/manager codes (e..g SGA for sage)
3. Account number
4. Custodian Contact ( 3rd party)
5. Manager Contacts (e.g. Sage. figured out from email addresses in the email)
6. Feed: e.g. connection via sftp

Once a ticket if manually created from contents of email sent by clients they are sent to DOTS, Dashboard

- next time, need to categorize top 10 email clients and document their the completeness of their email requests id what's good and bad
- also need to understand dev side of effort: are you looking for requirements for the dev team to use as basis for development/testing?
- who are the developers?
- Vee sent me an example of good email request (FW: Reynders (RMC) - Add Account to Goulston & Storrs Master Feed **Sample of a good email. **)
- exports from dashboard (Dashboard reports (Tickets and Detail Accounts) - for Sage (SGA)
	- Electra Data (17) = Tickets for SAGE
	- Electra Data (18) = Accounts /Details for SAGE
		
- RM’s (Relationship Manager aka Contact at the Custodian)  info not currently available
- AMP = Account Management Portal for Tickets (which feeds into DOTS). Internal only.
- Dashboard is what clients to see file statues, tickets statuses, Account Numbers, File names.
