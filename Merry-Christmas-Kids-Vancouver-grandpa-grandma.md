# Hello

Hello kids,

I wish both of you, Alex and Sophie, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. It was good to see Sophie over the Thanksgiving week and would also like to see Alex and talk about things like we used to, one of these days?. Can we both work on it? 

Grandpa has been in ER for a week after a massive stroke that damaged parts of his left and right brain. There will be no further treatments. Doctor says he does not feel any pain and is comfortable. We are leaving tomorrow on the 25th PM and go see him first thing at VGH on Friday 26th.

Grandma's condition has also been steadily declining.

Grandma just passed. She fell of the bed face down with a nose bleed.
