## What is it
CVE images can refer to ==a Docker or container base image that is free of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), or images that have known security vulnerabilities==. The term can also refer to images of specific security flaws. The context determines the meaning, but the most common use case is finding and fixing vulnerabilities in software containers.
