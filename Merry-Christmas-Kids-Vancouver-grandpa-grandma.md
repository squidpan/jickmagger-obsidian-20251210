# Hello

Hello kids,

I wish both of you, Alex and Sophie, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. It was good to see Sophie over the Thanksgiving week! Also, I would very much like to see you Alex and catch up on things like we used to. Can we both work on it? 

Grandma passed away this morning in her room on Christmas eve.  We are flying out to Vancouver tomorrow and so will Chi-ah. We spoke to Mom everyday for the past month and also yesterday. 

Grandpa is getting no further treatments after a massive stroke from a week ago. Doctor says he feels no pain and is comfortable. We are going to VGH first thing Friday morning on the 26th and hope nothing bad happens to him until we see him for the last time.
